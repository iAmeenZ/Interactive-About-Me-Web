# Interactive-About-Me-Web
A simple website without a backend that emphasizes a beautiful, attractive and very user-friendly UI. Completed on 14 December 2020.

An individual assignment/task that must be done to get marks in the subject of Web App Development.
This simple web does not use any backend data, in fact it is more user interactive by using interesting animations.
This work does not use any UI framework from any existing framework, it is self-developed from scratch in addition to using some packages for small animations such as fontawesome and unpkg.
